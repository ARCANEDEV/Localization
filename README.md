Easy i18n localization for Laravel, an useful tool to combine with Laravel localization classes.

The Localization package was inspired from [mcamara/laravel-localization](https://github.com/mcamara/laravel-localization).

 > :warning: Beware, this package is still under some heavy development and interface is subject to change.

Official documentation for Localization package can be found at the [Localization Wiki](https://github.com/ARCANEDEV/Localization/wiki).
